# Flashcards App

## Description

This project was made with the intention of learning and practicing React and TypeScript.

It is an app that lets the user create decks of flashcards and organize them using labels. The cards are simple and
consist only of name and content. Additionally, you may add one or more labels. You can then browse all the cards in a
deck or all cards with a particular label.
